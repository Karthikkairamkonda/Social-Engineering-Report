# 🎭 Research Report: Social Engineering Attacks

## 🎯 Objective

To research and present a detailed report on various types of social engineering attacks such as phishing, pretexting, and baiting. This report also provides real-world case studies and prevention strategies.

## 🧠 What is Social Engineering?

Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. These attacks exploit human behavior rather than technical vulnerabilities.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### 1. **Phishing**
- Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity via email or messages.
- Variants: Spear Phishing (targeted), Whaling (high-profile targets), Vishing (voice phishing), and Smishing (SMS phishing).

### 2. **Pretexting**
- The attacker creates a fabricated scenario (pretext) to steal personal or financial data.
- Example: Pretending to be IT support requesting login credentials.

### 3. **Baiting**
- Using a false promise (like free music or USB drives) to trick users into downloading malware.

### 4. **Tailgating/Piggybacking**
- An unauthorized person physically follows an authorized person into a restricted area.

### 5. **Quid Pro Quo**
- Offering a service or benefit in exchange for sensitive information.

## 📚 Case Studies

### 🔸 **Twitter Bitcoin Scam (2020)**
- Hackers used social engineering to access Twitter's internal tools.
- High-profile accounts (Elon Musk, Barack Obama) were hacked and used to promote a crypto scam.
- Caused financial and reputational damage.

### 🔸 **Target Data Breach (2013)**
- Attackers phished a third-party HVAC vendor.
- Accessed internal Target network, compromising data of over 40 million customers.

### 🔸 **RSA Security Breach (2011)**
- Employees received a phishing email with an Excel attachment.
- Led to the compromise of sensitive authentication data used by many companies.

## 🛡️ Recommendations to Prevent Social Engineering

1. **Employee Awareness & Training**: Conduct regular cybersecurity awareness training.
2. **Phishing Simulations**: Run mock phishing campaigns to test and educate staff.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds a layer of protection beyond passwords.
4. **Verify Requests**: Confirm identity before sharing sensitive info (especially over phone or email).
5. **Limit Privileges**: Apply the principle of least privilege for user access.
6. **Use Email Filters**: Deploy spam filters and domain reputation systems.

## 🧾 Conclusion

Social engineering attacks exploit human weaknesses, making them a persistent threat. Organizations must adopt a proactive approach with training, verification practices, and technical safeguards to mitigate these risks.
